# Demand Letter Workflow

Complete guide to creating, refining, and finalizing demand letters.

## Overview

The demand letter workflow consists of five main stages:

1. **Create** - Start a new demand letter
2. **Analyze** - AI extracts facts from documents
3. **Generate** - AI creates first draft
4. **Refine** - Iteratively improve the letter
5. **Finalize** - Export and deliver

## Creating a New Demand Letter

1. Navigate to "Demand Letters"
2. Click "New Demand Letter"
3. Fill in details:
   - **Case Name**: Descriptive identifier
   - **Template**: Select template to use
   - **Documents**: Choose source documents
4. Click "Create and Analyze"

The AI begins analyzing your documents immediately.

## Document Analysis Phase

### What the AI Extracts

The AI identifies:
- **Parties**: Plaintiff, defendant, witnesses
- **Incident**: Date, location, description
- **Injuries**: Medical conditions, treatments
- **Damages**: Medical bills, lost wages, property damage
- **Timeline**: Key dates and events

### Reviewing Analysis

1. Wait for analysis to complete (20-30 seconds)
2. Review extracted facts in Analysis Panel
3. Check for accuracy:
   - Names spelled correctly
   - Dates accurate
   - Damages calculated correctly
   - Important facts included

### Editing Analysis

**To edit a fact:**
1. Click the edit icon next to the fact
2. Modify the information
3. Save changes

**To add missing facts:**
1. Click "Add Fact"
2. Select fact type
3. Enter information
4. Save

**To remove incorrect facts:**
1. Click menu (⋯) next to fact
2. Select "Remove"
3. Confirm

### Approving Analysis

Once satisfied with the analysis:
1. Review all extracted facts
2. Click "Approve Analysis"
3. The system is ready to generate your letter

**Or request refinement:**
1. Click "Refine Analysis"
2. Provide instructions: "Focus more on medical injuries" or "Include witness statements"
3. AI re-analyzes with your guidance

## Letter Generation

### Initial Generation

1. After approving analysis, click "Generate Letter"
2. AI uses your template + extracted facts
3. Generation takes 5-10 seconds
4. Draft appears in the editor

### What to Look For

- Correct party names
- Accurate facts and dates
- Appropriate tone and language
- Logical flow and structure
- Complete damage calculations
- All template sections filled

### Editor Features

**Text Editing:**
- Full rich text editor
- Bold, italic, underline
- Lists, headings
- Direct text editing

**Sidebar:**
- Analysis facts (reference)
- Template variables
- Document excerpts
- Refinement history

**Toolbar:**
- Save draft
- Generate new version
- Request refinement
- Export options
- Share/collaborate

## Refining Your Letter

### Requesting Refinements

If the letter needs improvement:

1. Click "Refine Letter" button
2. Describe what you want:
   - "Make the tone more aggressive"
   - "Add more detail about medical treatment"
   - "Strengthen the negligence argument"
   - "Increase the demand amount to $150,000"
3. Click "Submit"
4. AI generates new version (5-10 seconds)

### Refinement Examples

**Tone Adjustments:**
- "Use more formal language"
- "Adopt a firmer, less conciliatory tone"
- "Make it more professional and less confrontational"

**Content Changes:**
- "Elaborate on the pain and suffering"
- "Add more legal citations"
- "Reduce the length to 2 pages"
- "Focus more on future medical expenses"

**Structural Changes:**
- "Reorganize to put damages first"
- "Add a section on comparative negligence"
- "Include more details about the accident scene"

### Iteration Limits

- Unlimited refinements
- Each refinement costs AI tokens
- Track iterations in refinement history
- Best practice: 2-3 refinements per letter

### Comparing Versions

1. Click "Version History"
2. View all generated versions
3. Compare side-by-side
4. Revert to previous version if needed

## Manual Editing

You can edit the letter text directly:

1. Click in the editor
2. Type or modify text
3. Auto-saves every 30 seconds
4. Manual save: Ctrl+S / Cmd+S

**Combining manual + AI:**
- Generate base with AI
- Manually fine-tune specific sections
- Request AI refinement of manual edits
- Final polish manually
