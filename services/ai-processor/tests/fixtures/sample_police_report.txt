On January 15, 2024, at approximately 2:45 PM, I responded to a two-vehicle traffic accident at the intersection of Main Street and Oak Avenue. Upon arrival, I observed two damaged vehicles in the intersection.

Vehicle 1 (Honda Accord driven by Sarah Johnson) was traveling northbound on Main Street. Vehicle 2 (Ford F-150 driven by Robert Williams) was traveling eastbound on Oak Avenue.

According to witness Emily Davis, who was standing at the northeast corner of the intersection, Vehicle 2 (F-150) proceeded through the intersection while the traffic signal displayed a red light. Vehicle 1 (Accord) had a green light and entered the intersection when struck by Vehicle 2.

The point of impact was in the center of the intersection. Vehicle 1 sustained major damage to the driver's side doors and quarter panel. Vehicle 2 sustained major damage to the front bumper, hood, and right fender.

Driver Sarah Johnson complained of neck and back pain. Springfield Fire Department EMS was on scene and transported Johnson to Springfield Memorial Hospital for evaluation and treatment.

Driver Robert Williams stated he "didn't see the light change" and admitted he may have been distracted by his phone. Williams exhibited no signs of injury and declined medical treatment.
